## Hodge Laplacian of Brain Networks


The code performs the Hodge Laplacian based modeling of cycles in brain networks. 
The code also performs various Hodge Laplacian based computations published in 

Anand and Chung 2023 [Hodge Laplacian of Brain Networks](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/anand.2023.pdf), IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 42:1563-1573.

The script [EXAMPLE.hodgelaplacian.m](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/EXAMPLE.hodgelaplacian.m) explains how to compute the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacin using Figure 2 example given in the paper. The script [SIMULATION_Anand.2022.TMI.m](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/SIMULATION_Anand.2022.TMI.m) performs the simulation study given in the Validation section of the paper. 
A shorter MICCAI confernce version of the paper is published in 

Darkurah, S., Anand, D.V., Chen, Z., Chung, M.K., 2022 [Modelling cycles in brain networks with the hodge Laplacian](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/dakurah.2022.MICCAI.pdf), MICCAI, LNCS 13431:326-355, which received the travel award as one of the best papers in the conference. 

The script [SIMULATION_Dakurah.2022.MICCAI.m](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/SIMULATION_Dakurah.2022.MICCAI.m) reproduces the simulation study done in the MICCAI paper.


The **Hodge-decomposition** is explained in Anan, D.V., Chung, M.K. 2024 [Hodge decomposition of brain networks](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/anand.2024.ISBI.pdf), ISBI. Poster version is available here.
