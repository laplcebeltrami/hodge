Hodge Laplacian for Graphs and Brain Networks

Authors: Vijay D. Anand, Dakurah, S., Chen, Z., Chung, M.K., University of Wisconsin-Madison

The code performs the Hodge Laplacian based modeling of cycles in brain networks. 
The code also performs various Hodge Laplacian based computations.  


The script EXAMPLE.hodgelaplacian.m explains how to compute the Hodge Laplacin using Figure 2 example given in
