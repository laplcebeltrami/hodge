## Hodge Decomposition of Brain Networks

The Hodge-decomposition is explained in Anand, D.V., El-Yaagoubi, A.B., Ombao, H., Chung, M.K. 2025 [Hodge decomposition of functional brain networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10542), arXiv:2211.10542, which is under review. The paper provides extensive validation and comparisions. Run  SIMULATION hodgedecompose.m to duplicate the simulations in the paper.

Shorter proof-of-concept conference paper is available:
Anand, D.V., Chung, M.K. 2024 [Hodge decomposition of brain networks](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/anand.2024.ISBI.pdf), ISBI. This is the first paper on the Hodge decomposion for brain networks in literature. Poster version is available [here](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/anand.2024.ISBI.poster.pdf). The script [Example-HodgeDecomposition.m](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/Example-HodgeDecomposition.m) explains how to perform the Hodge Decomposition of a given connectivity matrix.

## Hodge Laplacian of Brain Networks

The code performs the Hodge Laplacian based modeling of cycles in brain networks. 
The code also performs various Hodge Laplacian based computations.
