## Hodge Laplacian of Brain Networks


The code performs the Hodge Laplacian based modeling of cycles in brain networks. 
The code also performs various Hodge Laplacian based computations published in 

Anand and Chung 2023 [Hodge Laplacian of Brain Networks](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/anand.2023.pdf), IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 42:1563-1573.


The script [EXAMPLE.hodgelaplacian.m](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/EXAMPLE.hodgelaplacian.m) explains how to compute the eigenvectors of Hodge Laplacin using Figure 2 example given in the paper. The script [simulation](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/hodge/blob/main/SIMULATION_Anand.2022.TMI.m) performs the simulation given in the Validation section of the paper.
